This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this project ?

This Project is a fake Purchase-Dialog, with a 3D model to preview an item's looks with different colors.
It's purpose is entirely to learn React.JS and Babylon.jS.

## How do I take a look at it myself ?

You should have node (npm) installed.
Clone the project to your PC and execute `npm install` inside it, if you encounter problems with that make sure all dependencies are updated with `npm ci`.

After everything has been set-up, you are already ready to view the project for yourself and edit it!
Run `npm start` to start the development server and enjoy!

In case it doesn't happen automatically, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the webapp in the browser.
